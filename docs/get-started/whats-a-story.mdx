A story captures the rendered state of a UI component. Developers write multiple stories per component that describe all the “interesting” states a component can support.

The CLI created example components that demonstrate the types of components you can build with Storybook: Button, Header, and Page.

Each example component has a set of stories that show the states it supports. You can browse the stories in the UI and see the code behind them in files that end with `.stories.js` or `.stories.ts`. The stories are written in Component Story Format (CSF)--an ES6 modules-based standard--for writing component examples.

Let’s start with the `Button` component. A story is a function that describes how to render the component in question. Here’s how to render `Button` in the “primary” state and export a story called `Primary`.

<CodeSnippets path="button-story.md" usesCsf3 />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

View the rendered `Button` by clicking on it in the Storybook sidebar.

The above story definition can be further improved to take advantage of [Storybook’s “args”](../writing-stories/args.mdx) concept. Args describes the arguments to Button in a machine-readable way. It unlocks Storybook’s superpower of altering and composing arguments dynamically.

<CodeSnippets path="button-story-with-args.md" usesCsf3 />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Both story examples render the same thing because Storybook feeds the given `args` property into the story during render. But you get timesaving conveniences with args:

* `Button`s callbacks are logged into the Actions tab. Click to try it.
* `Button`s arguments are dynamically editable in the Controls tab. Adjust the controls

### Edit a story

Storybook makes it easy to work on one component in one state (aka a story) at a time. When you edit the Button code or stories, Storybook will instantly re-render in the browser. No need to refresh manually.

Update the `label` of the `Primary` story, then see your change in Storybook.

Stories are also helpful for checking that UI continues to look correct as you make changes. The `Button` component has four stories that show it in different use cases. View those stories now to confirm that your change to `Primary` didn’t introduce unintentional bugs in the other stories.

Checking component’s stories as you develop helps prevent accidental regressions. [Tools that integrate with Storybook can automate this](../writing-tests/index.mdx) for you.

Now that we’ve seen the basic anatomy of a story let’s see how we use Storybook’s UI to develop stories.
