It's useful to write stories that [render two or more components](../writing-stories/index.mdx#stories-for-two-or-more-components) at once if those components are designed to work together. For example, `ButtonGroups`, `Lists`, and `Page` components.

## Reusing subcomponent stories

The simplest approach we can take is to reuse the stories of the `ListItem` in the `List`:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="list-story-unchecked.md" usesCsf3 />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

By rendering the `Unchecked` story with its args, we are able to reuse the input data from the `ListItem` stories in the `List`.

However, we still aren’t using args to control the `ListItem` stories, which means we cannot change them with controls and we cannot reuse them in other, more complex component stories.

## Using children as an arg

One way we improve that situation is by pulling the rendered subcomponent out into a `children` arg:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<IfRenderer renderer={['react','solid' ]}>

<CodeSnippets path="list-story-with-unchecked-children.md" usesCsf3 />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Now that `children` is an arg, we can potentially reuse it in another story.

However, there are some caveats when using this approach that you should be aware of.

The `children` `args` as any other arg needs to be JSON serializable. It means that you should:

* Avoid using empty values
* Use caution with components that include third party libraries

As they could lead into errors with your Storybook.

<Callout variant="info">
  We're currently working on improving the overall experience for the children arg and allow you to edit children arg in a control and allow you to use other types of components in the near future. But for now you need to factor in this caveat when you're implementing your stories.

## Creating a Template Component

Another option that is more “data”-based is to create a special “story-generating” template component:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeSnippets path="list-story-template.md" usesCsf3 />

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

This approach is a little more complex to setup, but it means you can more easily reuse the `args` to each story in a composite component. It also means that you can alter the args to the component with the Controls addon.
